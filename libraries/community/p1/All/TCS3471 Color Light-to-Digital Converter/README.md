The TCS3471 Color Light-to-Digital Converter uses a 4x4 photodiode array (four each of red, green, blue and clear filters) to convert light to digital values with 16 bit resolution. Also on board are four integrating ADCs, amplifiers, accumulators, clocks, buffers, comparators, a state machine and an i2c interface. Transfers to registers are double-buffered for integrity. The TCS3471 includes an interrupt pin with programmable persistence allowing threshold control as well.
