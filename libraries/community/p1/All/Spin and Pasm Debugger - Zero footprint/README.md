Can debug 1 cog via the serial port. Commands are issued from the pc. No space is taken in the cog as it hides in the shaddow registers. Spin and Pasm can both be debugged. In fact, spin can even be debugged at the pasm level. I experimented with a crude following of a compiler listing from homespun or bst.
