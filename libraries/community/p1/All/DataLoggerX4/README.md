Logs the Propeller pins using 4 interleaved cogs. Records 1880 samples at 12.5nS rates or slower and then dumps to the serial port for saving and opening in PropTool to view as a timing diagram using PropTools special font.

Timing based on propeller running at 80MHz. Higher speeds available using overclocking.
