This is a driver object for the specific Wintek WD-C2401P LCD module. Based on another LCD object by Simon Ampleman (object 106) and requires the timing module from the parallel lcd object by Dan Miller (object 113).

  
Two objects are included, one with basic high level functions, and another with all of the usable low level functions (mostly) implemented in v 1.0. There is a well documented demo for each of the objects.

  
This was definitely a learning project, I hope it helps somebody out. Feel free to report any bugs.
