If you remember learning the basics of graphing and rates of change from Algreba 1, that's what this program is. Just like using 2 sets of coordinates to graph a line, this program uses 2 sets of INs and OUTs.

Linear conversion can be very useful for many things as you can imagine (ie scaling up/down sensory input), this object just does the heavy lifting for you :)

Code is fully documented.
