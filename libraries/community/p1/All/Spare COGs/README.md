Silly and simple...  
I wanted to monitor COG usage and see what COGs were assigned, when they are released and how many I have spare.  
This object has 2 functions - freecount which returns the number of free COGs and freestring which returns an 8-character zero-terminated string pointer with a dot in each character position if the cog is in use and the cog-number if it is free.
