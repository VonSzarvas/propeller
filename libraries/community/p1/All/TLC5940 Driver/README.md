The TLC5940 is a 16 channel, 12 bit resolution, LED driver. The TLC5940 is used in Brilldea's LED Painter project. This is a functional TLC5940 driver but only uses the upper 8 bits of the 12 bit resolution. The driver is written in SPIN and there is a seperate grey scale clock driver written in assembly. This driver is not 1.0 as there is still room for improvement.
