"An inductive sensor is one of a class of sensors called proximity sensors, which detect objects without actually touching them. Photoelectric sensors and capacitive sensors are also found in this category. The inductive proximity sensor only detects metallic objects and ignores all others, and has many industrial uses which capitalize on this feature."
