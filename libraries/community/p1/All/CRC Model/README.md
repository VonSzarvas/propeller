# CRC Model

Language: Spin

Created: Apr 4, 2013

Modified: April 4, 2013

This module is a Spin code adaptation of the public domain C code originally described by Ross Williams in his "A PAINLESS GUIDE TO CRC ERROR DETECTION ALGORITHMS", which is included in this archive.

This code will compute any 16 or 32 bit CRC given the appropriate model parameters. A test module is provided for sample usage, as well as several common CRC models.
