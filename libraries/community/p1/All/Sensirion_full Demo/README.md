A full-featured driver for the Sensirion SHT-11 temperature/humidity sensor, based on the original object by Cam Thompson.

This object is backwards-compatible with the original and adds methods to:

1.  Enable control of the sensor's "advanced" functions.
2.  Enable calibrated sensor temperature and humidity output without the need to use the floating point routines.
