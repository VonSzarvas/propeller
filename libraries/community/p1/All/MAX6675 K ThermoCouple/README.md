MAX6675 K ThermoCouple controls a chip from Maxim that directly measures the temp from a K type thermocouple. It has the tables built in so is very easy to use. Data Sheet included. Two version are included , one that runs as an object the other that runs in a seperate COG. Both measure temp in degrees C in counts 0 being 0 degrees C and 50 being 50 deg C.
