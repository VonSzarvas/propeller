A simple/lightweight driver object for interfacing with the Melexis MLX90614 non-contact temperature sensor via the SMbus (pseudo-I2C) interface. This object is for interfacing to the raw sensor itself (not a breakout board version).

Features include:

*   A simple/minimal serial-terminal-based demo that dumps EEPROM & RAM to terminal for examination
*   Supports output in ¬∞C and ¬∞F
*   Functions to provide low-level (register) read/write access
*   Small object code size
