This Quickstart demo is based on  "40000-Touch-Buttons-LED-Spin-Demo-v1" provided by Parallax Inc.                      

This demo is an entertaining and educational aid about a single-cog real-time programming technique and state machine that is responsive to button touches while performing an independent process that displays visually interesting patterns while the processor waits for a button press.
