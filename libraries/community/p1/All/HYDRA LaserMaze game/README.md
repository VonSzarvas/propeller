HYDRA LaserMaze v1.1 by Thomas M. Doylend A little puzzle game that uses the HEL GFX engine. Use the gamepad to move the smiley. Collect all the keys to move to the next level. Beware of the laser doors that shut when you pass through them! If you get stuck, you can push START to replay the current level. As of now, there is only 1 REALLY EASY level.
