This is mainly a demo program to show new users how to hook up some interesting Parallax devices, and bring together a program that uses existing Objects to demonstrate these devices. Extensive comments are used to help newcomers learn how to pull all the objects together and hook up the hardware.

The program uses three existing Propeller objects by other authors to demonstrate use of the Parallax GPS unit, an SD Card to save the GPS NMEA sentences, and the Parallax 7" Mini LCD A/V Color Display to display the GPS data. Data can also be seen using the Parallax Serial Terminal window if the LCD Display is not available.
