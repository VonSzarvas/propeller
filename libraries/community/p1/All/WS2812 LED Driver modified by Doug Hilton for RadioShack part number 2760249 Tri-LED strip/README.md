This code updates JonnyMac's nice WS2812 sample 'jm\_ws2812' to properly execute on a RadioShack p/n 2760249 Tri-LED strip.    
The timing constants are different, but no big deal.  The RadioShack LED strip is pretty cool, and I've also tried using the  
AdaFruit LED strips which work in a similar manner.  I hope this update saves a new coder some time in figuring out these  
LED strips.  Note that the code for this part number and the newer Radio Shack 2760339 are different in 2 respects.    
First, the RGB layout is different and second, the timing constants are different.
