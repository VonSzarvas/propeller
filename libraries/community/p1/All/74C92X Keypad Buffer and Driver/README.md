Updated version of my 74C922 4x4 keypad chip driver and buffer.

This version works with the 74C922 and the 74C923.

This version has the following methods; start, stop, read last key, read the size of the buffer, clear the buffer, and search the buffer for a specific key value.

Added a feedback function to drive an LED or buzzer (via transistor etc).

Datasheet for the 74C922/74C923 is included.
