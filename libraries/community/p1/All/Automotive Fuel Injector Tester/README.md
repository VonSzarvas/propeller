This program generates 1.5 millisecond power pulse for one minute at 1,200 RPM to test Automotive Fuel Injectors.

The P4 is connected to signal input on Injector Driver Module (available from: www.okaauto.com)

When injector is directed to callibrated cylinder the fuel delivery can be tested and the spray pattern can be observed.

User can change the pulse duration and RPM, if required.
