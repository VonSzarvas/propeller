Simple Spin function to calculate the day of the week from an input year, month, and date (assumes Gregorian Calendar). Properly accounts for leap years.

Far from rocket science, but since I couldn't find a pre-made object with this sort of simple calendar function, I had to write my own.

I thought someone else might get use out of it too. :-)
