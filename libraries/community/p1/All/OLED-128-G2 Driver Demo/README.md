General info:

This is a simple/small driver for the OLED-128-G2.  This driver uses the common Parallax serial terminal as it's main  
communication system.  This OLED is a good choice for many reasons and seems to have a little bit of everything.  It  
can draw boxes, lines, triangles. It can display text and graphics and makes it relatively easy to understand.  It is  
capable of 65 thousand colors in two bytes and has a resolution of 128x128 pixels.  It also uses a reliable  
communication system.
