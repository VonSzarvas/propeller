I teach a class _(ENT234)_ in Microprocessors in the spring semester at Berkshire Community College. Last spring one of my student's final project was to implement Bresenham's line drawing algorithm in assembly language. I think he did an excellent job. This could be further improved and other functions added. My plan for this spring's class is to offer his project to be extended by another brave student.
