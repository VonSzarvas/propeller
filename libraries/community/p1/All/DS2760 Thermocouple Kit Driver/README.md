This code is for use with the DS2760 Kit from Parallax. This code reads the values out of the DS2760 and calculates the thermocouple temperature.

Warning: this object is not perfect yet. There are some odd values/conditions that are not properly trapped yet. If you find a way to better it, please let me know via PM on the forum. Thank you.
