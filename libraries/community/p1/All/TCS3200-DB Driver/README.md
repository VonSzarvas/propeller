This object is for reading the colors from the TCS3200 color sensor. I had some problems in getting some code to do this, so I hope that if you were experiencing the same problems as me, that this would sort them out. I've tried to add a good comment section up the top, if its not good enough, try posting on the forums, I might hear you. I hope this works.
