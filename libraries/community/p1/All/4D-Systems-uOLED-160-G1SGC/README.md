SW programming interface to the 4D Systems uOLED-160-G1SGC display and carrier board (latter supports a joystick and speaker). The software contained here for this display conforms to revision 4.0 (March 9, 2011) of the GOLDELOX-SGC Command Set Software Interface Specification. The PmmC firmware for the GOLDELOX-SGC graphics processor on the display board must be up to date in order to fully utilize all the software commands implemented here. Much of this code was adapted from the ¬µOLED-160-GMD1 object written by Steve McManus.
