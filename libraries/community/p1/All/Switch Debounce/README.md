Debounce single or multiple buttons or switches, either   pullup or pulldown. Two  examples are included, one in  main memory and one in a cog. The libraries are the ones written by Trent Cleghorn and use  the  algorithm  of  Jack Ganssle. The code is fully commented and easily adaptable.  These are  C libraries but C++ are available from Trent Cleghorn on GitHub.  The code was written  in SimpleIDE and the .side files are included.
