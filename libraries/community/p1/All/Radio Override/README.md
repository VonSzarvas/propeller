A slightly more efficient method of reading servo pulses than the ones I found.

This object contains a servo32 implementation and will allow you to mix incoming servo pulses with internally generated signals (or override the internal signals with incoming signals if they are valid servo pulses, i.e. if a transmitter is in range).

Useful for autopilots.

NAVCOM AI compatible (email me for NAVCOM source code please).
