MMBE.spin

MMBE.spin is a product of my learning, being based upon Simple_Serial.spin.
I have been using the driver to power the Motor Mind B Enhanced controller
in a work environment, successfully. Please contact Alex Stevenson at 
astevenson@lorch.com or PM Aleks on the parallax forums with any advice,
constructive criticism, questions, or interesting applications so that I can
continue to update the driver.

	~8-28-2008
		The driver has been modified to implement the FullDuplexSerial.spin
		driver instead of Simple_Serial.spin. The getstatus command has
		been modified to work more efficiently, and checkdir and setdir
		have been added to work with the motor direction.
