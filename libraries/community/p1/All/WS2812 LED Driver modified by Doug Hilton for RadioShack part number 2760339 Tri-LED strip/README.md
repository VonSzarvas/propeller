This code updates JonnyMac's nice WS2812 sample 'jm\_ws2812' to properly execute on a RadioShack p/n 2760339 Tri-LED strip.  The timing constants are different, but no big deal.  The RadioShack LED strip is pretty cool, and I've also tried using the AdaFruit LED strips which work in a similar manner.  I hope this update saves a new coder some time in figuring out these LED strips.
