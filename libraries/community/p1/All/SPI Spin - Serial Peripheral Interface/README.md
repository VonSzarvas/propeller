This SPI-Spin demonstration uses the DS1620 temperature sensor via a serial connection to your PC to demonstrate how to use the SHIFTIN and SHIFTOUT functions of the SPI object.

The SPI-Spin version co-exists with the cog that calls the SHIFTIN or SHIFTOUT function and does not use an additional cog.
