Ok, it's called a configuration-file-reader because that's what I'm gonna use it for first. But it can also be used to do other things. Like reading data files or even for building your own little script language.

Have a look at the testCR.spin and the desk2.ini to find out more. Prerequisits for running the testCR:

SD Card

Terminal program attached to the programming-port.

(When terminal is connected, please hit any button to start the test.)

Prerequisits for the Object: NONE
