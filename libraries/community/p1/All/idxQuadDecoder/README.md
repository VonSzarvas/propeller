Modified Quadrature Decoder object by Luke Hays to use a third pin to preset encoder count to any value allowing the calculation of absolute encoder angle. See Luke Hays' example for reference. The same except uses third pin for index and allows preset by setting the value of BigValue in the asm section of the program.
