This terminal application is a Steady State Kalman filter. It uses the "FPU\_Matrix\_Driver.spin" object. The general coding framework is demonstrated with the "Bicycle with better GPS" example. Steady State Kalman filters with matrices up to the size of 11-by-11 can be programmed using this application.
