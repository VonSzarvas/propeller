Tab-delimited, UTF-8 encoded file showing the mapping of characters from the Propeller ROM to Unicode.

Columns are as follows:

*   **propeller\_index** ‚Äî Position of the character in the Propeller ROM font
*   **utf\_decimal** ‚Äî UTF code point in the Parallax font (in decimal)
*   **utf\_hex** ‚Äî UTF code point in the Parallax font (in hex)
*   **utf\_name** ‚Äî Name of the UTF character or "PRIVATE USE"
*   **comment** ‚Äî Description of character, suggested usage
*   **utf8\_character** ‚Äî The actual character displayed (UTF-8 encoded)

Three files are included; they differ only in the line-endings used.

If you're trying to load this file into a spreadsheet and the file is getting truncated make sure that no text delimiter character is set.

Comments welcome, especially regarding the electronics symbols.
