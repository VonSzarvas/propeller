  Connect the prop's tx pin through a 4.7K resistor
  to the ummc's rx pin and the prop's rx pin through
  a 4.7K resistor to the ummc's tx pin.  This way if
  there is any error neither device will be harmed.
               
  Start a terminal emulator on the com port
  used by the Propeller Tool.  Set 8N1 and
