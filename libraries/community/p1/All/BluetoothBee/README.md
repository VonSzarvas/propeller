A spin object to interface with Seed Studio's Bluetooth Bee over UART connection. This is an early version that does work for pairing, tx, rx, and scanning for devices, but does not do all the parsing of responses that it should.

I have a blog post that demonstrates using this object to talk to an iPad over bluetooth: http://wp.me/p2erMq-5.
