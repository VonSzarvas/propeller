Introduction
------------

PROPSHELL is a simple library to create serial shells on the Parallax Propeller. It could be used for both machine to machine communication and human to machine communication.

Usage
-----

To demonstrate the usage, three examples are provided:

*   **SimpleExample:** shows the basic concepts behind propshell (command definitinos, command processing, error handling etc.)
*   **LEDShellExampleH2M:** shell to interact with a human. Allows to operate the build in LEDs of the Propeller Quick Start board.
*   **LEDShellExampleM2M:** same as above but focused on machine to machine communication (more cryptic commands and and responses, no help etc.)
