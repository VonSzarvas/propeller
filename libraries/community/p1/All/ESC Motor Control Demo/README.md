A simple program to drive an ESC to control a Brushless Motor from the Prop using the PC keyboard to vary the speed.

Values of 0/12.5/25/37.5/50/62.5/75/87.5/100% can be set which corresponds to a signal on time of 1ms (OFF) to 2ms (100%) with an off time of 20mS.

This code is an extension of Gavin's Single\_Servo\_Assembler program in the OBEX.
