This PST terminal application proves the H48C\_Sync\_Driver.spin object. This driver object can synchronize the data readouts of H48C Tri-axis accelerometer modules. In this demo four H48C sensors are synchronized. The uniform timing and precise intervals of the synchronous readouts are verified.   
 

The H48C\_Sync\_Driver can be used in 6DOF IMU projects where four H48C tri-axis accelerometers are arranged in space to provide a cheap but precise close equivalent of high dollar 6DOF IMU sensors. See attached PDF file for the mathematical details.
