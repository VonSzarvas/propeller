This is an object which encodes 16-bit stereo 44.1/48 KHz audio into an SPDIF signal. SPDIF is the protocol used by TOSLINK (optical) and Coax digital audio inputs on most home theater receivers and stereo systems. Some PC sound cards also have SPDIF inputs. Play high-quality audio on your Prop using only an LED!

Includes two demos: A modified version of the Hydra Sound System with 48 KHz SPDIF output, and a simple player for WAV files stored on an SD card.
