BoeBotBasic is a modified version of FemtoBasic designed to run on a Protoboard on a BOE-BOT chassis. It supports the wheel servos and a PING bracket servo, a PING sensor, an IR emitter/detector/distance sensor, and an HM55B compass. It uses a serial console via either an xBee wireless link or the USB programming port. Some sample programs are included. Like FemtoBasic, programs and data can be stored on an attached SD card. See the beginning of the BoeBotBasic.spin file for a change log. Fix: SD card turned off when unmounted (thanks Cluso99). Documentation for KEYCODE corrected.
