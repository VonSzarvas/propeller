This is a sample of a spin project I created sometime ago to create a replacement graphical instrument display.

It shows:

*   How to easily assign color palettes to screen tiles. 
*   Create a grid overlay to see where the object fall into place within the tiles. 
*   How to get around the double buffering if you're low on RAM. 
*   How to create a tachometer type display by using vector graphics. 
*   Create smoothly updating displays by tracking the changes in the data behind the display. _(Only change what you have to)_

I know it's not documented the best, but most will be able to see how it works. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

It will run on a Prop Demo Board with a simple button wired to Pin 7 pulled high to 3.3v with a 10K resistor. It uses the TV out.
