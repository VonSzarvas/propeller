This is a very basic object for using Adafruit 16 channels servo driver ( https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver/overview ) which is based on NXP PCA9685 chip ( dtatsheet > https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCA9685.pdf ). It is made for a single board but you can chain as many as you like, declaring multiple instances of the object, or adapting the object code to your needs.
