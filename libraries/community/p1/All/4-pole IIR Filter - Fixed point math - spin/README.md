A 4-element infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter with recursion, implemented in spin. This filter is best suited for low-to-moderate bandwidth filtering applications (e.g. filtering accelerometer or Ping))) data). Uses fixed point integer math. Also includes various supporting filter synthesis functions.
