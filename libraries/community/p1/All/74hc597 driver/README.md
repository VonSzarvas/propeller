74hc597 v1.0

Data acquisition cog reading up to 4 74hc597's in series. A 74hc597 is an 8-bit latch/shift register. It grabs digital inputs in two stages. This cog free runs sampling constantly. It is a great way to read multiple switch inputs without taking up a bunch of prop ports The 74hc597 is a good choice as it can run at 3.3v.
