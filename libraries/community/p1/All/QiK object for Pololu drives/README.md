Replaces the previous version. This main program and object can be used to set parameters and test the QiK drives. See QiK doc's for more information.

The test program has a text basedmenu to manupulate most functions and set and read parameters.

Don't forget to wire the Rx-signals from teh drives to the propellor via a SN7407 like open collector buffer.
