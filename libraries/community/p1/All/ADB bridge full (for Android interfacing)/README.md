Uses usb-fs-host, gives the Propeller MULTIPLE shells or TCP sockets into an Android phone.

The apk source is very basic in its behavior -- write to the Prop in the upper textbox, read from the Prop in the lower (using your favorite terminal app prop-side). The buttons send data to the serial ports. There are also commands for the prop to change the baud rate and use COM0 as a console or not, more are easy to add.

If you want to use this for robot control, send me an email, there is better code that can be had :)

This is based off microbridge for the arduino+usb host shield http://code.google.com/p/microbridge/
