A PASM driver that reads data from a PlayStation 2 and automatically updates joystick and button values to variables in parent object.

Digital and Analog modes may be switched by method calls. This object will also read the pressure information from the 12 analog buttons.

I used Juan Carlos Orozco's PS2\_Controller as starting point.

Includes a demo showing how to read the analog buttons.
