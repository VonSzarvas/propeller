# Servo Pulse Input

Language: Spin

Created: Apr 16, 2013

This object reads standard R/C servo pulse widths from a device such as a receiver. It can read an arbitrary number of channels and stores the pulse widths as integer microseconds in the same format used by Servo32.spin.

The object could be useful for channel mixing or autonomous vehicle development.
