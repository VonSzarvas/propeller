Unzip all the files in the distribution into the directory where the Propeller Tool that you are currently using resides (we will refer to this directory as the PropTool directory).

On my machine, the PropTool directory is c:\Programs\Parallax Inc\Propeller Tool v1.2.6  

Your version depends on how well you are keeping up with new versions.

In the PropTool directory, right click on PreSpinAAC.exe and create a shortcut. Drag this shortcut to the desktop.

While in the PropTool directory, locate the manual (PreSpinAACManual.chm) and either drag it to the desktop next to the PreSpin shortcut, or create a shortcut to the manual and drag this shortcut to the desktop (again next to the PreSpin shortcut).

Double click on the manual icon and go to the Quick Start topic.  (It might be nice to read at least the Introduction topic along the way :)

Note: PreSpinAAC has an easy way to open the manual, so the manual icon will no longer be needed after one has become familiar with PreSpinAAC operation.
