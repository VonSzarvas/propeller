This PS2 Controller interface object allows the user to send multi-byte commands to the controller for configuration. The user may put the object in a polling-loop to continuously read the inputs. The test harness supplied was tested against several controllers including a wireless GuitarHero controller. The documentation contains schematics, protocol details, and URL links for more information.
