An LED Sequence for the Parallax Propeller P8X32A Quickstart (Rev.A) with code demonstrating bit shifts and binary logic in a fun to watch demonstration. Enjoy!

**NOTE:**

I have updated the file _"LED\_Sequence\_BitxBit.SPIN"_

with a new file called _"My\_LED\_Sequence.SPIN"_

which is a much more clean & professional, or otherwise

easier to read and understand program.

The new program is considered Rev.B of the original.

Both function **exactly** the same but the coding looks

far better on the new file. Hope you enjoy!
