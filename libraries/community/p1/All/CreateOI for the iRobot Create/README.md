# CreateOI for the iRobot Create

This object implements all of the features of the iRobot Create.  The object handles all of the Sensor Data polling and provides functions to drive, control outputs, and retrieve inputs and sensor values.  The object also manages X and Y coordinates based on running distance and angle calculations (works better if you add a digital compass).  This is the main brain for all of my iRobot Create projects.
