This is a basic driver for the Emic Text-to-Speech module.

It allows you to give it text or numbers to say, change the volume/speed/pitch, soft/hard reset, and add/delete abbreviations. It is not dependent on additional objects, doesn't use up any cogs, and is fully documented. =)

Included is a test program to get you up and running quickly.

More features are available in the Extended version, in case you want to do more with it such as grabbing version numbers and the abbreviation table.
