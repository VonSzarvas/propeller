This object talks to the HT16K33 16\*8 LED controller. It includes (x,y) pixel accessors for the 8x8 bicolor LED matrix backpack from Adafruit:

You can use this object to talk to any HT16K33-controlled display e.g. all of the Adafruit backpacks.

The 8x8 matrix-specifics include a line-drawing function copied from the propeller forums. But line drawing is somewhat anticlimactic on an 8x8 display.
