The AD7705 and AD7706 are complete 16-bit, low-cost, Sigma Delta ADCs intended for dc and low-frequency ac measurement applications.  
An integrated amplifier makes it possible to measure voltages up to microvolts range. This enables direct use of thermocouples for temperature measurement.  
This object interfaces to a ad7705 adc chip. It can also be used for a different chip from the ad77XX family.
