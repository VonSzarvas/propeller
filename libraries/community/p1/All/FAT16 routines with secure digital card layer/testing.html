Thank you for helping to test this software!
<p>
The <a href="test.spin">test.spin</a> routine is what we want to run.
In order to run this best, we recommend you read this entire
document.
<p>
Copy <a href="sysdep_demo_ser.spin">sysdep_demo_ser.spin</a> to
sysdep.spin, and edit it for your configuration.  Pay particular
attention to the clock frequency, where the SD card is attached,
and how you want to supply input and output.  If you do not have an
input mechanism, make the rx method return " " the first time it is
called and make it sit in an infinite loop all subsequent times
(so the test is run exactly once).
<p>
If at all possible, reformat your secure digital card using
32K clusters (if it is 256MB or larger); for other sizes refer to
the formatting instructions.  This step is not necessary but it
will help us get consistent results.  Note that the cluster sizehas the biggest effect on the pwrite speed (smaller clusters = slower writing).
<p>
Be aware the test may destroy any data you have on your card;
in particular, it destructively smashes a range of blocks starting
at 8MB (you can modify this in test.spin if you want, to be closer
to the end of your card, or nearer the beginning if your card is smaller than 16MB). If you do not want to take the risk
of losing your data, we recommend you do not run this test.
<p>
Download test.spin to your system, insert the card, and
run the program.  By default the program waits for an input
character to be typed (to give you a chance to set up PropTerm or
whatever terminal program you are using.)  Any character should
start the test.
<p>
The test is rather chatty; if it fails, it will fail pretty
loudly.  Don't worry about writing things down as they scroll
by; performance numbers will be collected and then printed again
at the end of the test.
<p>
What we would like to get is the following:
<ul>
<li>The size and brand of your SD card.</li>
<li>Whether this test fails in some way on your system.</li>
<li>The clock frequency of your propeller system.</li>
<li>The test results; cut and paste if possible, but a screen shot
or digital photograph is fine too.</li>
<li>Any problems you had configuring or running the test.</li>
</ul>
Please feel free to post the results directly to the thread we have
created in the Parallax Propeller forums so we can all learn.  (Note that the standard Parallax Serial Terminal does not allow you to Copyto the Clipboard, but PropViewer does.)
