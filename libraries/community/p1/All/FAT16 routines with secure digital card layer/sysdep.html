<body>
For the fsrw test program and other utilities, all system
dependencies (such as the console input and output device, the
system clock frequency, and how the secure digital card is
connected) are abstracted out by the sysdep.spin file.
<p>
By default, no file is supplied, but examples are supplied for
some common Propeller platforms.  For example, the file
<a href="sysdep_demo_ser.spin">sysdep_demo_ser.spin</a>
describes an 80MHz Propeller on a
Parallax demo board, with console I/O to the serial port,
and with the SD card attached starting at pin 0.  If this is
your setup, you can just copy this file to sysdep.spin and
then everything else will compile.  Otherwise, browse the
available sysdep*.spin files, pick the one closed to your
setup, copy it to sysdep.spin, and edit it for your environment.
<p>
Once you've done this, future releases will use that for
the system dependencies and you should not need to edit any
other files.
