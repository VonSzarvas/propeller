<body>
FSRW has the following limitations.  Some of these will be
addressed in future releases.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Files larger than 2GB are not supported.</li>
<li>On FAT32, only the first cluster of the root directory is
    supported (but for 32K clusters, this is up to 1000 files.)</li>
<li>Subdirectories are not supported.</li>
<li>Long file names are not supported.</li>
<li>Seeking is not supported.</li>
<li>Only one file at a time may be open.</li>
<li>We ignore the write-protect tab on cards (we have no signal line for
this presently).</li>
<li>For cluster sizes below 32K, write speed can be significantly
slower because the Propeller does not have enough memory to buffer much
of the FAT.</li>
<li>If a card is somewhat full, writing the initial block of a new
file could take a while as the FAT is scanned.
We can improve this somewhat.</li>
<li>No explicit date or time support yet.</li>
</ul>
