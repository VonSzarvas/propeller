This is a (simple) sample program to display the current:

*   Clock Frequency & Mode
*   Current Cog
*   Available Cogs

The code is provided to start free cogs and stop them in order to find which cogs are available.  
The results are displayed to the serial device, but could simply be substituted for TV/VGA/LCD etc, or code cut and pasted into your code.
