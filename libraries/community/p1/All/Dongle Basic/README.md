Dongle Basic is a modified version of FemtoBasic intended for use with Hitt Consulting's Propeller Dongle or any other minimal Propeller board like the PropStick or PropStickUSB. It requires only the serial port used for programming, but will use an SD card on I/O pins 8-11 if present. Like FemtoBasic, it provides access to the I/O pins and counters and can use any EEPROM present for programs or data. See the beginning of the DongleBasic.spin source file for a change log. Fix: SD card turned off when unmounted _(thanks Cluso99)_. Documentation for KEYCODE corrected.
