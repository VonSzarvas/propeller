Modified version of Raymond Allen's (Rayman) original driver.  
After permission of MIT licensing.  
The LCD driver adds bigchar support using the Propeller ROM fonts. One is a version with double buffer, it has an higher footprint but it is faster.  
Both version have the same functions, it is possible to switch between the two version just changing the object name.
