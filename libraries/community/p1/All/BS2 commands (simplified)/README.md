This object is perfect for Propeller beginners coming from a BS2 background! It is not complicated and has full instructions for operation in the comments. You can get a "Hello World" program running in no-time! This object needs the FullDuplexSerial object, which is also available on the OBEX. You will also need the Parallax Serial Terminal, which should be installed on your computer if you have Propeller Tool 1.2.6 or up. This object will give you the following commands:

*   Pause(time)
*   High(pin)
*   Low(pin)
*   Input(pin)
*   Sleep(period)
*   Count(pin,duration,variable) 
*   Debug(str)
*   Random 
*   Toggle(pin)

Instructions on how to integrate them into your program are in the comments at the header of the program. If you have any questions or suggestions for new commands, contact me at microcontrolled@gmail.com
