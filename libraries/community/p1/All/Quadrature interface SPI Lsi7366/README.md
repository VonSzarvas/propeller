For position control of robotics and machinery, a relable quadrature encoder interface is a must. This demoapplication show how to use the Lsi 7366 as encoder interface. Aside counting edges of an encoder, the Lsi 7366 has a compare and trigger (latch) function. for the lsi7366 and demoboard you can look at www.propbotics.eu
