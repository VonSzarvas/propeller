# ColorPAL

This is an object that lets you scan the colors red, green, and blue with the Parallax ColorPAL (part #28380). You can also use this object to produce a 24 bit color on the ColorPAL's LED cluster. The object requires the "simple\_serial" object which is included.

This is a very minimal implementation. If you have requests for features or suggestions for improvements, please feel free to email me at georgeecollins@yahoo.com.

For version 1.1: I reduced the baud rate to 4800 and fixed a bug in "GetBlue" that caused it to confuse the red and blue values.
