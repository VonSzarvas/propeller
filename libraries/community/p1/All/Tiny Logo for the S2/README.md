Tiny Logo implements a lot of Logo commands plus access to all of the S2. It comes with limited string and very limited list support. Since it is large, the archive contains crippled versions of the S2.spin and S2Music.spin objects with songs tables removed. Please report any bugs to tinylogo@daumling.com, and let me know how you like it!
