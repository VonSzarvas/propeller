I found plenty of LCD Drivers out there.... but none I tried seemed to work for this particular one I had.... it is a 20x4 LCD driven by a PCF8574.... I used this display with Arduino for a while... it was easy to use and didn't take up additional pins (assuming I was using other i2c devices).

This C Library was modelled after an Arduino library.
