This is an Extended driver for the Emic Text-to-Speech module.

It allows you to give it text or numbers to say, change the volume/speed/pitch, soft/hard reset, add/delete abbreviations, \*grab the version numbers of Emic hardware/software, receive the abbreviation table, and control the AIN pin.\* It is not dependent on additional objects, doesn't use up any cogs, and is fully documented. =)

Included is a test program to get you up and running quickly.

Less features are available in the Basic version (everything encased in the \*s are only in the Extended), but it provides all necessary operations and takes up less program space.
