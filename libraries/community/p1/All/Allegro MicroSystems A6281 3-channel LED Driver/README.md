This driver is for running a daisy chain of Allegro MircoSystems A6281. Th A6281 IC is a three channel, 10-bits per channel LED driver. The Brilldea PolkaDOT product series uses the A6281 LEDs and red, green, blue (RGB) LEDs. More information about PolkaDOTs is available at http://www.brilldea.com/.

Included in the zip file is the driver and a demo of how to use the driver. If you have questions or a recommended improvement, let me know through a PM on the Parallax Forum.
