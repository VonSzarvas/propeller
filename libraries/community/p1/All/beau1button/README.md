This code snippet demonstrates a method for implementing a simple 1-button user input method. Works surprisingly well and is the simplest, cheapest possible form of user input. Ideal for situations where user input is limited to some known set of values that the user doesn't need to input very often _(such as setting time or setting parameter values in an embedded app)._

v1.1 - fixed several bugs and added a timeout/abort functionality

v1.2 - Added presentMenuDisplay method 

Added example showing how to do sub-menus
