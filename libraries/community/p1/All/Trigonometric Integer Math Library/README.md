A trigonometric integer math library. The code has been fully optimized with a super simple spin interface for maximum speed and is also fully commented.

Provides full support for:

*   Taking the SIN of an angle (0-360),
*   Taking the COS of an angle (0-360),
*   Taking the TAN of an angle (0-360),
*   Finding the ARCSIN of a triangle,
*   Finding the ARCCOS of a triangle,
*   Finding the ARCTAN of a triangle,
*   Preforming the ATAN2 calculation,
*   Preforming the DISTANCE calculation,
*   Calculating integer powers,
*   Calculating random numbers,
