The SimpleSD object provides access to the "first file" on a freshly formatted SD card. This allows you to exchange data with a computer without using a full-featured FAT library. The code is short and simple and to the point. If you need simple access to data on an SD card, but you don't want to pull in the resources of a large library then this object is for you.
