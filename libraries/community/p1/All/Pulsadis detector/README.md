Pulsadis is a remote control system using electric power distribution lines as physical support. It's mainly used ine Europe and particularly in Belgium and France to control public lighting, low/high rates periods, etc. This project detects Pulsadis frames and stores them on a memory card for further processing. It may also extremely easily control Leds, relays, ... Just a few cheap hardware components are required.
