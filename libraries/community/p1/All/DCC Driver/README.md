Driver for Model Railroad DCC (Digital Command Control)controller. This low-level driver output packets in the NMRA (National Model Railroad Assoc.) standard format. External circuitry can be used to interface to a standard "booster" or H-bridge circuit to actually drive the track. Example of "syncronous" timing of precision output pulses.
