This technique, rather than object, demonstrates how to store the PASM portion of an object into the upper area of EEPROM (above 32K). This technique is used to reclaim back the HUB RAM that would otherwise be lost to objects which are only instantiated at startup.

An demo object in it's original and modified form is included for practical demostration purposes.
