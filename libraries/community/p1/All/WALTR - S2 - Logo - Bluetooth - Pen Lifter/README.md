WALTR (Wireless, Apple II, Logo, Turtle, Robot) - Using S2 Robot - Includes Bluetooth and Pen Lifter.

WALTR is an S2 robot that takes in direct action or interpreted Logo movement commands via a serial connection and executes them. Although I designed WALTR to be run from an Apple II computer any computer with a serial port and a Logo software package that supports serial communications can be used. WALTR can still be used as a Logo robot even without its pen lifter and Bluetooth enhancements.

Examples attached for these following Logo versions :-  
FMSLogo (free Windows package), Apple Logo II by LCSI \[1984\], Apple Logo by LCSI \[1983\], Terrapin Logo V1.0 \[1981\]
