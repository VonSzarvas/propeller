I have provided WALTR.LOGO, WALTR.REDEFS.LOGO and HOUSE.LOGO files on data.dsk because they need to be in the correct file format.
If you do not use data.dsk but instead copy the files over yourself you may get formatting issues. If you have formatting problems see AppleII_Data_Disk_Setup.txt :-

Instructions on running the example:-

Run Logo.
Insert disk with WALTR.LOGO, WALTR.REDEFS.LOGO and HOUSE.LOGO files then type the following
LOAD "WALTR  
LOAD "HOUSE
HOUSE
