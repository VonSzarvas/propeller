This is a Spin Driver for Velleman VMA203 LCD display (16x2) using 4-Bit Data Code and total of 6 Pins on Propeller.

All six lines can be connected directly to Propeller Pins, no need for any resistors or Voltage translators.

The VMA203 needs to be powered from +5VDC (for example from Activity Board) and only draws 30mA.

The documentation provided by Velleman is rather poor, but the proper connection diagram is available here:

Separate DEMO Object using this Driver is also provided.
