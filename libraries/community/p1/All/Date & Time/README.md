Date/Time contains two objects to handle calendar dates and times. Demos are provided to show the function of each method. One handles a byte string with year, month, day, hour, minute, and second directly over the date span of 1900 to 2155. The other implements Unix or MS-Dos time values in a 32 bit long. Documentation and examples provided.
