date_time contains two objects to handle
calendar dates and times.  Demos are
provided to show the function of each
method.  One handles a byte string with
year, month, day, hour, minute, and
second directly over the date span of
1900 to 2155.  The other implements
Unix or MS-Dos time values in a 32 bit
long.  Documentation and examples provided.
