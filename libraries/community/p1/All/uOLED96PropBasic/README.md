# uOLED96PropBasic

By: Michael Green

Language: Spin, Assembly

Created: Oct 15, 2007

This is a modified version of FemtoBasic designed for the 4D Systems uOLED-96-Prop display with an integrated Propeller controller and uSD card socket. In addition to the usual FemtoBasic features including SD card support, this has a series of statements for controlling the display. The console is serial port because of the small size of the display and the absence of a standard keyboard interface. The archive includes a Basic version of 4D Systems' demo program. See the beginning of the uOLED96PropBasic.spin file for a change log. Fix: SD card turned off when unmounted (thanks Cluso99). Documentation for KEYCODE corrected.
