To install on a uOLED-96-Prop:1) Using the Propeller Tool, download uOLED-96-Prop-Basic.binary to the Propeller EEPROM on the uOLED-96-Prop.2) Using Windows (or other OS), mount a uSD card and copy the file OLEDdemo.bas to the uSD card, then unmount the card and install it in the uOLED-96-Prop.  You can also install other Propeller programs (like the uOLED-96-Prop demo) by compiling them and saving the binary files to the uSD card.  The file names must conform to 8.3 format (8 characters in the filename and 3 in the file extension).  I recommend using .bin for extensions for binary images.3) Use HyperTerm or any other serial terminal emulator configured for use with the uOLED-96-Prop's programming port at 9600 Baud, 8 bits, no parity, no handshaking.4) You probably won't see the program identification banner since it may be discarded by the terminal emulator.  Type a return and you should see OK.  At this point the Basic interpreter is working.  You can load the Basic demo program by typing LOAD "OLEDdemo.bas".  It will take 15-30 seconds to load and you'll see OK again.  At that point, you can type RUN and the demo will execute.  You can run other compiled Spin programs by using the SPIN command as described in the manual.

5) If you copy OLEDdemo.bas to the uSD card with the name autoexec.bas, it will automatically execute after a delay for Basic initialization and the loading of the Basic program.  No terminal emulator needs to be running for this to work.
