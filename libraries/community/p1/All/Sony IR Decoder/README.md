Implements some of the ideas in Andy Lindsay's IR Remote for the Boe Bot in propeller spin. Decodes five bits from a Sony IR TV remote and provides for displaying the result on one seven segment display or the debug terminal. Captures ten digits, volume up and down, channel up and down, power, and OK. Should be easy to expand to more bits, other displays, or other actions as needed.
