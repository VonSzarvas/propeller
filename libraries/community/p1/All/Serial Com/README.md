\*repaired a minor issue with the LCD driver

A communication routine loosely based on I2C with included demo programs to communicate between two Propeller IC's. 

**Note:**  
This has only been tested on the Spin Stamp, whereas this is the only propeller I have access to. It requires a CS, SDA, and CLK line to operate. I have had success communicating between the two stamps I used, and displaying the results on an LCD screen. My contact info is in the Readme.txt.
