Included in this object is

Simple_Serial.spin

	A wonderful program developed by Chip Gracey, Phil Pilgrim, 
and Jon Williams that I use for serial communication in LCD. spin, 

Numbers.spin
	
	Another wonderful program developed by Parallax that I use
to simplify certain parts in LCD. spin, and

serial_com.spin, 
serial_com_example.spin, 
serial_com_slave.spin, 		
serial_com_slave_example.spin,	and
LCD.spin 

which are all programs written by Alexander Stevenson (myself), aka 
Aleks on the parallax forums. I have put a lot of effort into providing 
these programs and have opted to share them online for anyone who may 
make use of them. Feel free to contact me with any questions or
concerns or suggestions at astevenson@lorch.com. Keep in mind I'm
only an 18 year old who started programming in PBasic a year ago, 
and made the drastic transition through the Javelin Stamp to the 
Propellor just within the past 3 months. This is my career for the 
time being, and any suggestions or constructive criticism is very 
appreciated. Enjoy

*******| Revision history |*******

8-20-2008 -> Addressed a minor issue with the LCD driver which forced the LCD 
	to be on pin 4. Now the declaration of the LCD pin and the baud rate
	are actually used instead of disregarded. Also took time to revise 
	programs accessing LCD.spin to compensate for change.
