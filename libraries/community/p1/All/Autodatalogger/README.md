**Note: The Memory Stick Datalogger is discontinued by Parallax. A better idea is to use an SD card with one of the great drivers here in the Obex.**

This program will automatically log hub variables as fast as possible to the USB Datalogger from Parallax. It does this in the background, with no oversight once start is called. Logging will continue until a critical failure, loss of power, or the Spin function stop is called.
