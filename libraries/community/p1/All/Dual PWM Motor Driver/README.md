A dual PWM motor driver that runs in one cog. The code has been fully optimized with a super simple spin interface for maximum speed and is also fully commented.

Provides full support for:

*   Changing the duty cycle for the left motor between -1000% to +1000%.
*   Changing the duty cycle for the right motor between -1000% to +1000%.

Ajusting the pwm frequency. Good for controlling various devices with different frequency characteristics.
