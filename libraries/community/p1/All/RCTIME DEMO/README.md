RCTIME - Measuring the RC time constant is a common method used to convert analog signals into digital signals. It is used to read a fixed or variable resistance, such as a potentiometer (Volume Knob, or Joystick), photo sensor (CdS Cell), Thermistor (Temperature), etc.

This object demonstrates a popular function found on the Basic Stamp. Unlike the Basic Stamp, this object has two modes of operation. One for background RCTIME operations and another for foreground (Stamp Like) RCTIME operations.
