Monitors the clock frequency present on given pins. Passively monitor a clock already present on a pin, or attach a wire to an unused pin and monitor the frequency of something external.

There are two demos supplied. One demo simply displays the vsync and hsync frequencies of the VGA signal. The other demo monitors the frequency of the singing seven demo.
