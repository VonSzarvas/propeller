# Hydra Morse Code Sender

This program uses the Hydra Keyboard to send Morse Code of the letters typed. (Not all keyboard keys have Morse Code equivalents.) I have inserted code blocks into Andre Mothe's Keyboard Demo program which does the keyboard conversion and the letter display on the video. The audio (and the debug light) carries the Morse Code. The audio program is one that comes with the Hydra documentation.

It is still in a very basic condition and needs additional

features, but this program needs only the Hydra, its keyboard and a video monitor and audio amplifier to work.

Additional refinements in changing the arrangement of the letters in the CASE statement to put the most used letters first could be done, but I don't know if it would make much of any difference.

Have fun with it.
