The Sensirion Demo reads values from the Sensirion SHT-11 module and displays temperature, relative humidity and dewpoint using vga-text or tv-text. The calculations are a good example of using the Float32 routines. A seperate Sensirion object contains all low level interface routines suitable for use in other projects. An updated version of FloatString is also included.
