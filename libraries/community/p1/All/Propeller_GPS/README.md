Propeller\_GPS is a spin program that I wrote to learn how a GPS unit works.  I used the NEO-7M GPS unit which is available at a very

nominal price.  Eventually, I added a 64 x 128 OLED that incorporates the SSD1306 controller.  This is also readily avilable at a  very

nominal price.  With these two modules, and a propelle such as the Propeller Mini, you can construct your own portable GPS unit.
