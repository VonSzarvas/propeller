An object and demo program to control a SOMO-14D. The SOMO-14D is a tiny Audio-Sound module that can play back pre-stored audio files such as voice and music from a micro-SD memory card. This code was developed on a PARALLAX QuickStart module connected to a SOMO-14D module. Supported connection is a 2 wire (clk & data) serial interface but not I2C.
