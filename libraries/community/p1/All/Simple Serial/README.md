Bit-bang serial driver for low baud rate (~19.2K) devices. 

\* This driver is designed to be method-compatible with the FullDuplex serial object, allowing it to be used when high speed comms or devoting an independent cog for serial I/O is not necessary.  
\* Bi-directional communication on the same pin is also supported.
