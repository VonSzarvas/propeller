A very basic driver for the Memkey, relies on simple\_serial.spin (not included). Will continue to update based on user reviews and input. \*\*busy at work, VERY little time to tinker\*\*

Updated the driver to include program(...) and reset, used to personalize the key structure of the attached keypad, and to reset to default values, respectively. \*Work of Spencer Crockett\*
