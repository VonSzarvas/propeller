Included in this object is

memkey.spin 

which is a program written by Alexander Stevenson (myself), aka 
Aleks on the parallax forums, and Spencer Crockett, a work associate. 
We have put a lot of effort into providing this program and have opted 
to share it online for anyone who may make use of it. Feel free to 
contact us with any questions or concerns or suggestions at 
astevenson@lorch.com. Keep in mind we are both only 18 years old and 
started programming in PBasic a year ago, and made the drastic transition 
through the Javelin Stamp to the Propellor just within the past 3 months. 
This is our career for the time being, and any suggestions or constructive 
criticism is very appreciated. We will update this as necessary... Enjoy
