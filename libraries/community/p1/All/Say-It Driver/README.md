This is a driver for the Parallax Say-It Module (AKA VeeaR Module). It is meant to be a close conversion of the sample code written in P-Basic for the BS2 module re-written in .spin language.

  
It is fully documented with instructions on how to use the object. 

  
**NOTE:** This object does NOT program the SAY-IT Module with custom commands! To program the Say-It Module, you must use the downloadable PC software available seperately for the Say-It Module.
