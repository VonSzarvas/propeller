This is a demo and sample control code for the LISY300 gyro module. Building on the Parallax supplied SPIN code on the product page, this version uses an NTSC display and is highly remarked with explanations of the code segments and variables. It includes a circuit diagram primarilly for the demo board. First time users of the gyro module or those new to SPIN might find this version less cryptic and a bit easier to understand.
