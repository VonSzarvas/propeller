# Purpose
Community generated Propeller libraries for Propeller 1 microcontroller.

## History
Until 12/6/2019, Propeller 1 libraries were hosted on the Propeller Object Exchange, but are now contained in this repository.

### Folder Structure
Object source code and demos are contained within named subfolders of the __All__ folder.  The other folders (__Data Storage__, __Display__, etc) serve as categorical references of objects; providing Git-Hub-accessible links in the __readme.md__ and Linux/Mac-compatible filesystem links in the __symlink__ subfolder.
