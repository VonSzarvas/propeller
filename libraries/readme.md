# Libraries Folder
This folder contains Propeller 1 and Propeller 2 library (object) code developed and shared by the Propeller Community.  

## Contents and Structure
The "p1" (Propeller 1) subfolders contain object code migrated from the Propeller Object Exchange.  See the community/p1/All folder (for example).

As the Propeller 2 is tested and further materials are developed, its "p2" folder contents should evolve organically to stay organized- items categorized in subfolders similar to that of "p1."

Contributors can [create](https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/wiki/Contributing) and/or [suggest](mailto\\:developer+github@parallax.com?subject=Propeller+Repository+Suggestion) new or renamed subfolders when the need arises.
